# Weather-Dashboard

## This app allows the user to:

* search for a city 
* get the forecast for the current day
* also get the forecast for the next 5 days
* keep a search log of cities that they have already looked at
* clear that search log

## This was achived with HTML, AJAX, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JQuery, and Javascript.
